2201-COL106 DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS
Please note a minor clarification for Assignment 1.
The length of a drone program is the number of characters in the program.
For example, the length of the program '9999(+X)' is 8 (and not 9999).

Please ensure that your algorithm for Assignment 1 runs in linear time.
Otherwise, it is possible that the auto-grader succeeds on the visible test cases but times out on the hidden test cases.

You are recommended not to modify the Stack class.
It should have the same methods; how you implement them is up to you, as long as the implementation takes O(1) time.
 
The idea is to have a standard Stack class that you could reuse in several places, and not a problem-specific version of the class.
Hope this helps.

2201-COL106 DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS, If a test is shown to have failed in the "middle" part (autograder results), then it has failed, even though the right side (autograder score) says the test passed.
Thanks.

It is some python 3 specific thing where dividing 2 numbers gives a floating point result and there is a limit to a float whereas using // directly gives an integer result
